# Linux Virtual Machine & Command Line Project

## Objective
This project demonstrates Linux system setup, user configuration, directory management, text editing, and data analysis using command-line tools.
It was completed in a VirtualBox lab environment and documents essential Linux administration and data manipulation skills.

## Project Overview
- **Tools Used:** VirtualBox, Ubuntu, Bash CLI  
- **Focus Areas:**  
  - Virtual machine creation and configuration  
  - File system and directory operations  
  - Text editing and file manipulation  
  - Sorting, copying, and deleting files  
  - Data processing with **grep**, **awk**, **sort**, and **uniq**  

### Skills Learned
- Advanced understanding of virtualization and Linux operating system setup through VirtualBox.
- Proficiency in navigating and managing the Linux file system using core commands.
- Ability to create, edit, sort, copy, and delete files through command-line operations.
- Enhanced knowledge of text processing tools such as grep, awk, sort, and uniq.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills by applying the Unix philosophy of combining modular commands.

### Tools Used
- Advanced use of VirtualBox for virtualization and virtual machine management.
- Proficiency in deploying and configuring Ubuntu Linux as the operating system.
- Practical application of the Bash command-line interface (CLI) for system and file management.
- Utilization of the nano text editor for creating and editing configuration and data files.
- Application of core Linux utilities (grep, awk, sort, uniq) for text processing and data analysis.

## Steps

**Directory Creation**
- Here I demonstrate navigating the file system and creating a new directory for project work.
Commands like cd, mkdir, and pwd are applied to set up the workspace.

**File Creation with Nano**
- This section demonstrates the use of the nano text editor to create a text file.
The file contains a list of World Cup group participants and is saved as GroupAandB.

**Sorting and Creating New File**
- Here I used the sort command to organize the list of countries alphabetically.
The output was redirected into a new file called GroupAandB2.

**Copying and Deleting Files**
- This section highlights file management with commands like cp, ls, and rm.
The file was copied to /tmp, verified, and then deleted from the project folder.
